## 1. Exploring Differential Splicing Across Cell Types
**Objective:** Investigate how alternative splicing events differ between various immune cell types and their role in disease susceptibility.

### Tasks:
- Data Exploration: Load and preprocess the dataset. Filter splicing events by cell type (e.g., B cells, T cells).
- Visualization: Create bar plots and heatmaps showing the frequency of alternative splicing events in each cell type.
### Statistical Analysis:
- Perform a chi-square test to determine if certain splicing events are more prevalent in specific cell types.
- Correlate splicing event frequencies with genetic variants (cis-sQTLs and trans-sQTLs).
### Biological Insights: 
- Identify cell types with the most distinct splicing patterns and hypothesize their biological significance.
