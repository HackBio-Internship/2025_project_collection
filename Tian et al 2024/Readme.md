Alternative splicing contributes to complex traits, but whether this differs in trait-relevant cell types across diverse genetic ancestries is unclear. Here we describe cell-type-specific, sex-biased and ancestry-biased alternative splicing in ~1 M peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 474 healthy donors from the Asian Immune Diversity Atlas. We identify widespread sex-biased and ancestry-biased differential splicing, most of which is cell-type-specific. We identify 11,577 independent cis-splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs), 607 trans-sGenes and 107 dynamic sQTLs. Colocalization between cis-eQTLs and trans-sQTLs revealed a cell-type-specific regulatory relationship between HNRNPLL and PTPRC. We observed an enrichment of cis-sQTL effects in autoimmune and inflammatory disease heritability. Specifically, we functionally validated an Asian-specific sQTL disrupting the 5′ splice site of TCHP exon 4 that putatively modulates the risk of Graves’ disease in East Asian populations. Our work highlights the impact of ancestral diversity on splicing and provides a roadmap to dissect its role in complex diseases at single-cell resolution.
