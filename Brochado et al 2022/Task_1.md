## Functional Analysis of Membrane-Targeting Drugs
Objective: Focus on membrane-targeting drugs and their role in modulating synergies and antagonisms.

Tasks:
- Data Exploration:
  - Subset data for interactions involving membrane-targeting drugs.
- Visualization:
  - Create scatter plots and heatmaps showing the effect of membrane-targeting drugs on interaction scores.
  - Create subset heatmaps showing the behaviour of non antibiotic drugs with membrane targeting drugs 
- Statistical Analysis:
  - Conduct t-test to compare the effectiveness of membrane targeting and ribosome targetting drugs against vanillin
  - Conduct a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the effectiveness of membrane-targeting drugs in different strains.
- Biological Insights:
  - Discuss how membrane-targeting drugs could influence the efficacy of combination therapy.
